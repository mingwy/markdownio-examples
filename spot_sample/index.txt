Linear operators are at the core of many of the most basic algorithms
for signal and image processing. Matlab's high-level, matrix-based
language allows us to naturally express many of the underlying matrix
operations (e.g., computation of matrix-vector products and
manipulation of matrices) and is thus a powerful platform on which to
develop concrete implementations of these algorithms. Many of the most
useful operators, however, do not lend themselves to the explicit
matrix representations that Matlab provides. The aim of the Spot
Toolbox is to bring the expressiveness of Matlab's built-in matrix
notation to problems for which explicit matrices are not practical.

Here's simple example that shows how Spot operator primitives can be
stitched together using familiar Matlab commands to form more complex
operators:
