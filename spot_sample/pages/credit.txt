Spot makes extensive use of several free-software packages:

- the wavelet transforms are computed via the Rice Wavelet Toolbox
- these web pages are maintained using markdown

Spot is a complete rewrite of the operator library originally found in the Sparco Toolbox. The following individuals contributed to that package:
